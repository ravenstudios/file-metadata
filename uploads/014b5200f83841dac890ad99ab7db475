\par Spells: (4/2/1): 1st\'8a color spray, detect undead, grease,

\par Description: Celerum is 35 years old, 6\'99 2ld tall, and
\par thin. He has blond hair and piercing blue eyes.
\par Celerum dresses in a jet-black robe of the finest weave
\par with a jewel-inlaid gold belt.
\par Personality: Celerum is arrogant, cold, and calculat-
\par ing. He is completely amoral and will do anything that
\par furthers his own ends.
\par History: While researching spells for the late Dendy-
\par bar the Mottled, Celerum came across excerpts from
\par the diary of Damien Morienus. The diary contained
\par references to some type of potion of great power but
\par failed to describe the process of making it. Intrigued,
\par Celerum delved deeper into the archives of the Host-
\par tower, eventually discovering that Damien had a re-
\par search tower somewhere in Icewind Dale. He also dis-
\par covered that Damien, a former master of the North
\par Spire himself, was actually working on a recipe for lich-
\par dom but had not completed it before he mysteriously
\par disappeared with his tower. The tower\'99s disappearance
\par also coincided with a period of the Dale\'99s history called
\par the Great Thaw. Finding no further reference to
\par Damien, Celerum decided to search for himself.
\par Celerum traveled throughout Icewind Dale with a
\par friendly merchant, Boswell C. Peddywinkle. Peddywin-
\par kle had been traveling to the Dale for years, trading in
\par the valuable scrimshaw, and who had an impressive
\par network already set up for fishing on the lakes. Seeing
\par this as an opportunity too good to pass up, Celerum
\par killed Peddywinkle along the road and, using his hat of
\par disguise, has assumed the merchant\'99s identity.
\par Merchant Persona: Boswell C. Peddywinkle
\par Description: Boswell is 5\'99 4ls and quite pudgy, with a
\par regal look to him. He is around 50 years old, with a
\par great handlebar mustache and bright blue eyes. He has
\par very little hair left and what is there is pure white. He is
\par dressed in rich courtly dress.
\par Personality: Peddywinkle is very friendly, outgoing,
\par and talkative. He delights in the telling of fanciful sto-
\par ries about his exploits such as when he acquired a very
\par rare bauble that was a gift from the beautiful queen of
\par Salsa, who, by the way, was quite smitten with him.
\par Long-term goal: Peddywinkle/Celerum wants
\par Damien\'99s diary. If the PCs prevent him from getting it,
\par telligent monsters, or thieves) either to get the book if
\par the PCs have it or for revenge if they destroyed it (or
\par otherwise kept it from him). If the PCs foil his plan,
\par they\'99ll earn themselves a long-term foe in Celerum,
\par and perhaps all of the forces of the Hosttower of
\par Luskan.

, an onyx panther named Guenhwyvar (see the end of this entry for more information). Drizzt carries a mix of adventuring gear, including some drow and dwarven equipment.
\par }{\b Appearance:}{ Somewhat larger than a typical dark elf, Drizzt stands 5\rquote 4" and weighs ab
out 130 lbs. His handsome features are sharp and well proportioned; his white hair is long, flowing, and smooth. His violet eyes are windows to his passionate soul. He normally wears a fur-collared forest-green cloak and high black boots. It has been more
 than 70 years since he first ventured into the surface world and at present he is in the neighborhood of 140 years old\emdash still a young adult by elven standards.
\par }{\b Background: }{It would be impossible to recount all of Drizzt's legendary adventures (described in a series of novels by R. A. Salvatore, see }{\b Sources}{). The major events of his life are described here.
\par Drizzt was born into the ninth house of Menzoberranzan, called Daermon N\rquote a\rquote shezbaernon, more commonly known as Do\rquote Urden, on the night when that house wipe
d out one of its rivals. As a male in the matriarchal society of the drow, Drizzt was trained by his father, Zaknafein, to be a warrior.
\par Drizzt was first dienchanted and then disgusted by the corrupt, vicious nature of drow culture. He sought some means of escape. In the meantime, his family came to realize his abhorrent (to them) principles, and his father, the house\rquote 
s Weapons Master, gave his life to save his son when the family\rquote s matriarch wanted Drizzt executed as a traitor.
\par The path of Drizzt\rquote s life took an irrevocable turn away from the evil ways of his kind when he killed Masoj Hun\rquote ett, a drow who had been using a }{\i figurine of wondrous power}{
 for tawdry assassinations and other detestable work. In the magical panther named Guenhwyvar, Drizzt sensed a kindred spirit -- a fierce but brave and loyal warrior trapped in the drow\rquote s dark world of deceit. Drizzt liberated Guen from Hun\rquote 
ett, and later fled Menzoberranzan entirely.
\par He and Guen wandered the Underdark for a decade, always moving, until they found a 
grotto tended by the fungus people known as the myconids. While there was life here, Drizzt was still profoundly lonely. His only companion was Guen, and the magic that brought her to this world also sent the cat away all too often.
\par Not long thereafter, he
 discovered a city of svirfneblin, gnomes that live in the Underdark. This was what he had been seeking: a civilization that valued the same concepts of honor, loyalty, and goodness that he did. Careful not to reveal himself to the gnomes right away, Driz
zt stealthily made his way into, around, and then back out of the city he learned was called Blingdenstone.
\par Later, convinced that this was the life he was destined to have, Drizzt reentered the city -- only to be taken prisoner by the wary gnomes. Fortunate
ly, he came into contact with a deep gnome he had met once before. Before Drizzt fled from drow society, he had been assigned to go on a patrol. This patrol encountered a group of deep gnomes and killed them all -- except for one warrior named Belwar Diss
engulp. Drizzt, hoping to save at least one life from being massacred, pleaded with the other elves to spare this one\rquote 
s life -- arguing that it would be better to allow him to return to his people and tell of drow ferocity than just leave another corpse. Drizzt\rquote s brother Dinin did agree to let the gnome live, but chopped off both of Belwar\rquote s hands first.

\par When Drizzt again met Belwar, the gnome had two great metal hammers attached to his wrists in place of his hands. Belwar, remembering that Drizzt had saved 
his life, convinced the other gnomes to give him a chance. Drizzt proved himself soon thereafter when he, Belwar, and a pech named Clacker who had been polymorphed into a hook horror by a mad wizard worked together to defeat the wizard and the mind flayer
s
 that were in the area. During this time Drizzt also found himself facing his deceased father in combat. Zaknafen had been brought back as one of the undead by an unholy drow ritua. But, knowing that the creature was not truly his father, Drizzt spared no
 effort in destroying it.
\par Feeling he needed to put yet more distance between himself and his drow past, Drizzt fled to the surfilce world, where he witnessed a sunrise for the first time in his life.
\par He eventually met the blind ranger Montolio "Mooshie" DeBrouchee, who taught Drizzt the ways of the surface world and the concepts of being a ranger, and introduced him to the existence of the goddess Mielikki, the Lady of the Forest. With Mooshie\rquote 
s help, Drizzt began his career as a ranger, defeated a large band of orcs, and vanquished a pair of barghests.
\par After Mooshie passed away, Drizzt again took to wandering, this time on the surfac world. After a time he came to Icewind Dale and the region known as Ten Towns. Under the terms of a deal he made with Cassius, the region\rquote 
s leader, Drizzt took up residence in the area in exchange for his regular patrolling of the region to watch out for incursions of barbarians. 
\par Before long, Drizzt met the dwarf who was to become one of his dearest friends: Bruenor Battlehammer, who busy battling a remorhaz at the time. By the time Drizzt arrived to help, the beast was dead. Drizzt also came to know the dwarf\rquote 
s adopted human daughter Catti-brie and the halfling Regis.
\par When Bruenor spared the life of one of the barbarians who later attacked Ten Towns, Drizzt became acquainted with Wulfgar. Over time, the young man matured, due in no little measure to Drizzt\rquote 
s training him to use his brain as well as his brawn in battle. 
\par This training was put to good use when a power-mad mage attacked Ten Towns with a horde of humanoids. The townsfolk, barbarians, and heroes defeated the humanoids, and Drizzt overcame the tanar\rquote ri Errtu.
\par Drizzt and the other members of the band later accompanied Bruenor on his quest to retake his ancestral homeland
, Mirthal Hall. It was here that Drizzt met for the first time the man who would become his nemesis. The human assassin Artemis Entreri was originally after Regis the halfling, but found his mirror image, and his real foe, in Drizzt. After a battle with D
rizzt that proved inconclusive, Artemis kidnapped Regis, and the heroes followed him all the way to the distant southern city of Calimport to rescue their friend. Drizzt and Artemis met once more, but again there was no clear winner.
\par After releasing Regis, the heroes returned north and did reconquer Mithral Hall. All seemed peaceful for a time, but then drow spies found a way into Mirthral Hall from below, and Artemis returned, magically disguised as Regis.
\par Drizzt eventually found where Artemis was holding t
he real Regis, and the ranger and the assassin again did battle. They were both attacked by drow before any conclusion could be reached, however. They fought again later, and Artemis fell over a cliff. Wulfgar met his end at this time when, caught in the 
grasp of a handmaiden of Lolth, he used his magical hammer to collapse the ceiling onto them both.
\par Drizzt soon decided that he had to return to Menzoberranzan to put an end to the drow meddling in his life, and Catti-brie followed him. The pair eventually d
iscovered that Artemis was still alive and working for the drow -- though he suspected he was being used and would be killed as soon as he had done what the drow wanted of him. When the time came to flee back to the surface, the three of them worked toget
her to defeat the drow. Artemis and Drizzt seemed to have come to an accord and parted without further violence.
\par The same could not be said for Drizzt's other enemies. The drow, the fiend Errtu, and others all conspired in an attempt to bring down Drizzt an
d Mithral Hall. An army of drow and humanoid slaves invaded, and it took the combined forces of the dwarves, the deep gnomes, and the humans to defeat them.
\par Deciding again it was time to move on, Drizzt and his dear friend Catti-brie rode away from Mithral Hall. At present that is where Drizzt's tale ends -- but what is yet to be told is likely to be as thrilling as what has come before.
